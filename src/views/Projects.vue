                    In the KHOST CITY, Cars drive by the crowded area near the
                    local mosque, close to Zakokhil bridge. Amidst the crowd
                    stands Sakhi Jan Sarhadi, 70, a retired government official
                    living in Lakan Kamar village. He is recalling the hardships
                    the villagers faced before the bridge was built.
                    <br /><br />
                    “Before the bridge was built in this village, people had
                    lots of problems crossing from one side to the other side of
                    the river, especially patients,” Sakhi Jan Sarhadi says of
                    Zakokhil bridge over the Lakan River. The bridge, spanning
                    140 meters, connects Lakan Kamar village to Khost center.
                    <br /><br />
                    Sarhadi recounts how some people died during the floods
                    before the bridge was built. At that time, Lakan Kamar
                    villagers faced difficult challenges during winter and the
                    beginning of spring. During the rainy season, crossing from
                    one side to the other side of the river became a difficult
                    and dangerous task.
                    <br /><br />
                    The bridge, Sarhadi says, has resolved these problems,
                    including reducing transport costs to Khost city center from
                    200 afghanis (about $3) to 50 afghanis. “We used to go to
                    other villages far from ours and pass the river, but after
                    the bridge construction it costs us only 50 afghanis to
                    reach Khost center.”
                    <br /><br />
                    Nomar Shah, Head of the Public Works Directorate in Khost
                    Province, reaffirms the difficulties villagers had earlier:
                    “People had lots of problem reaching their destination,
                    especially students and patients. They had to spend a lot of
                    time to reach the center of the province.”

                    The development of Mirsarai Economic Zone (MEZ) will be
                    visible by 2018 as work on road construction, power plant
                    installation and earth-filling are going in a quicker pace.
                    "The zone will be developed in 30 phases by 2030. We have
                    already invited tenders for three phases for the development
                    of about 2,000 acres of land out of a total of 30,000
                    acres," Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) Executive
                    Chairman Paban Chowdhury told. He said development work,
                    like the construction of a four-lane road inside the zone
                    and 18.5-kilometer long two-lane marine driveway with a
                    protection embankment is going on inside and near the MEZ.
                    The zone is along the strategic location of Dhaka-Chittagong
                    industrial corridor under Chittagong district. MEZ will be
                    the country's first self-contained economic zone as it will
                    have park, sea port, residential area, power plant,
                    hospital, school and university, he added. The executive
                    chairman said investment proposals worth about US$8 billion
                    have already been confirmed for the MEZ from home and abroad
                    in various sectors, including steel, Liquefied Petroleum Gas
                    (LPG) and shipbuilding. Chowdhury expressed the hope that
                    MEZ would play a vital role in fulfilling the investment
                    prospect of the country through establishing a truly
                    world-class business and industrial center and attracting
                    the local and foreign investors. "As the zone is linked with
                    Dhaka-Chittagong industrial corridor, business costs and
                    cost of living are significantly low than those of the other
                    competing cities of the world," he added. The BEZA chief
                    said BEZA is implementing a project of Water Development
                    Board through China Harbour Engineering Company for
                    construction of the 18.5 kilometer two-lane marine driveway
                    with protection embankment from Sonagazi to Sitakunda at a
                    cost of Taka 1,163 crore. He informed that Rural Power
                    Company Limited (RPCL) is setting up a 150 Megawatt (MW)
                    power plant which will have an option to increase up to 1000
                    MW in future.

                    The Old Omdurman Bridge ( also redemption Bridge, or Old
                    White Nile Bridge ) is a steel truss bridge to traffic in
                    Sudan and the oldest bridge of the conurbation al -
                    Khartoum. It connects Khartoum on the White Nile to
                    Omdurman. The shore road on the Blue Nile in Khartoum (
                    Sharia al - Nil ) is extended to the west and crosses the
                    bridge to the nearby parliament building on the other side.
                    The bridge was designed by the London engineering firm Sir
                    Douglas & Francis Fox and from 1924 to 1926 by the Dorman
                    Long and Co. Ltd.. built. The working for the engineering
                    firm construction supervisor was Georges Camille Imbault,
                    who had worked for the office even at the Victoria Falls
                    Bridge. It is 613 meters long and is supported by seven
                    pillars round pairs. Originally it consisted of seven 74,20
                    m long trusses and a 92.50 m long swing bridge and was
                    intended for light trains. Later the tracks were converted
                    into lanes for road and outdoor grown on both sides of the
                    bridge each another lane. From 2004 to 2006, the bridge was
                    set by a South African construction company in status.

                    The MRT Line 6 (Bengali: এমআরটি লাইন ৬) is a line on the
                    Dhaka Metro Rail. Bangladesh's first rapid transit line, it
                    has been in service since 2022. It is an entirely elevated
                    line and currently has 9 stations in service between Uttara
                    North and Agargaon. The line was the result of the proposal
                    of a mass rapid transit system in Dhaka by the Review
                    Committee of the Strategic Transport Plan led by Jamilur
                    Reza Choudhury and the Urban Traffic Formulation Study
                    prepared by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. Its
                    construction started in 2016 that was delayed several times
                    as a result of disagreements about the route, the July 2016
                    Dhaka attack, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The first phase of
                    the line was gradually opened during 2022. The second phase
                    from Agargaon to Motijheel is currently under construction
                    and expected to open in 2023. It would bring the total
                    distance to 20 kilometers. An extension to Kamalapur is
                    expected in 2026. There is a plan to further extend the line
                    north towards Tongi and Savar Upazila in future. It is the
                    most expensive mass rapid transit line in terms of
                    construction cost in Asia.

                    project management and supervision consultant services in
                    connection with a major roads project in Afghanistan. The
                    four-year contract has an estimated value to Hill of
                    approximately $37.0 million. <br /><br />The Qaisar-Laman
                    Ring Road project, funded by the Asian Development Bank,
                    involves the upgrading of a 233-kilometer (145-mile) section
                    of the Ring Road between Andkhoy and Herat. Completion of
                    this project will conclude the various reconstruction works
                    on the nation's Ring Road and will fill a key gap in the
                    regional transportation corridor, facilitating north-south
                    commerce along Afghanistan's western border with Iran,
                    Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Completion of the Qaisar-Laman
                    section of the Ring Road will also widen access to markets
                    and socio-economic opportunities for the inhabitants of the
                    provinces of Badghis and Faryab, and support increased peace
                    and order in these remote rural areas.
